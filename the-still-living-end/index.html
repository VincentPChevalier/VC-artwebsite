				<h3>Project Description</h3>
				<p><i class="highlight">The Still Living End</i> is a short, experimental, single-channel video about AIDS nostalgia directed by Toronto based video artist Vincent Chevalier. This is a small independent project that will be produced at Western Front as part of a production residency in July 2018 and is funded through a grant from the Ontario Arts Council.</p>
				<p><i class="highlight">The Still Living End</i> is a nostalgic rendering of an original motion picture, portrayed through a meticulous recreation of its theatrical properties (props). The video will be a lush yet haunting tableau vivant or living painting featuring a collection of props sourced from Gregg Araki’s 1992 film, <i class="highlight">The Living End.</i> The props that make up the set of <i class="highlight">The Still Living End</i> tableau will consist of every object seen, heard, or spoken about over the course of the original film and will be arranged as if on the prop of a fictional film shoot.</p>
				<p>The visual and art historical reference for this project is the vanitas genre of classical painting. Like a vanitas painting, Araki’s film is saturated with reminders of our own mortality. <i class="highlight">The Still Living End</i> focuses on the technical elements of film production in order to ask what is <i>still living</i> if all else is stripped away?</p>
